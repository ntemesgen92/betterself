# BetterSelf -- Product Design Document & Development Plan

## Overview

**BetterSelf** (working title) is an iOS productivity app that combines two core pillars:

1. **Intelligent App Blocking** -- Uses Apple's FamilyControls / ManagedSettings / DeviceActivity frameworks with an AI accountability gatekeeper that manages blocking on the user's behalf (replacing the "friend who holds the Screen Time passcode" pattern)
2. **Voice-First AI Secretary** -- A professional AI assistant that manages calendars (Apple Calendar + Google Calendar), schedules events via natural language, optimizes schedules, tracks habits, and delivers daily briefings

### Target Audience

General productivity-focused users -- professionals, students, entrepreneurs, and anyone looking to take control of their time.

### Monetization: Freemium

- **Free tier:** Limited AI queries per day (e.g., 10), basic blocking (1 focus profile, daily limits), Apple Speech recognition
- **Premium tier ($X/month):** Unlimited AI interactions, advanced blocking (unlimited profiles, cold turkey mode, strict mode), detailed analytics/insights, high-quality AWS voice (Transcribe + Polly), meeting prep

### Team & Timeline

- **Team:** 2 developers
- **Timeline:** 2-3 months to MVP

## Architecture Overview

![BetterSelf Full System Architecture](diagrams/full_architecture.png)

> Generated from `diagrams/full_architecture.py` using the Python [diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/) library. To regenerate: `cd docs/design/diagrams && python3 full_architecture.py`

### Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | Swift + SwiftUI | Native iOS, best FamilyControls support |
| State Management | Combine + @Observable | Modern Swift concurrency |
| Local Storage | SwiftData | Offline cache for calendar, blocking rules |
| App Blocking | FamilyControls / ManagedSettings / DeviceActivity | Only way to block apps on iOS |
| Calendar | EventKit (Apple) + Google Calendar REST API | Two most popular calendars |
| Voice (free) | Apple Speech Framework | On-device, free, decent quality |
| Voice (premium) | AWS Transcribe + Polly | Higher accuracy, natural voices |
| Backend | Python (FastAPI) on AWS Lambda | Fast development, great AI library ecosystem |
| API Layer | API Gateway + Lambda (Mangum adapter) | Serverless, scales automatically |
| Auth | AWS Cognito | Supports email/password + Apple + Google sign-in |
| Database | RDS PostgreSQL (free tier) + RDS Proxy | All data in PostgreSQL. Single relational database avoids future migration when analytics, social features, and calendar recurrence require JOINs/aggregations. RDS Proxy handles Lambda connection pooling. |
| AI/LLM | AWS Bedrock (Claude/Titan) | Managed, stays in AWS, flexible model choice |
| Push Notifications | AWS SNS + APNs | Daily briefings, schedule reminders |
| Analytics | AWS Pinpoint | In-ecosystem, user engagement tracking |
| Infrastructure | AWS CDK (Python) | IaC, reproducible, team is experienced |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions + Xcode Cloud | Automated builds and deployments |

## Data Models

![BetterSelf Data Model ER Diagram](diagrams/data_models.png)

> Generated from `diagrams/data_models.py`. To regenerate: `cd docs/design/diagrams && python3 data_models.py`

### PostgreSQL Schema (RDS Free Tier + RDS Proxy)

> **Decision:** All data lives in a single RDS PostgreSQL instance with RDS Proxy for Lambda connection pooling. PostgreSQL was chosen over DynamoDB to avoid a future migration when analytics, social features, and calendar recurrence require relational queries (JOINs, aggregations, full-text search). RDS free tier (db.t3.micro, 12 months) keeps MVP cost low. RDS Proxy (~$15/month) eliminates Lambda connection exhaustion issues.

## Key Feature: AI Accountability Gatekeeper

When strict mode is enabled and a user tries to override a blocking session, the AI acts as a gatekeeper:

![BetterSelf AI Gatekeeper Flow](diagrams/ai_gatekeeper_flow.png)

> Generated from `diagrams/ai_gatekeeper_flow.py`. To regenerate: `cd docs/design/diagrams && python3 ai_gatekeeper_flow.py`

**Legitimate reasons (AI approves):** Genuine emergency, work-related urgent need, scheduled break time, physical safety concern

**Non-legitimate reasons (AI denies):** Boredom, "just want to check something quick," social media FOMO, vague reasons

The AI uses prompt engineering to be firm but encouraging. The 5-minute cooldown on approved overrides prevents impulsive unlocking.

---

## AI Secretary Capabilities

### Natural Language Actions

The AI secretary understands natural language commands and maps them to calendar/task actions:

| User Says | AI Action |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Schedule gym 3 times this week" | Creates 3 calendar events, finds optimal time slots based on existing schedule |
| "What does my day look like?" | Generates daily briefing with schedule, tasks, and focus recommendations |
| "Move my 2pm meeting to Thursday" | Reschedules event, checks for conflicts |
| "I need to finish the report by Friday" | Creates a task with Friday deadline, suggests focus sessions |
| "Block social media during work hours" | Creates/updates a blocking profile for Mon-Fri 9am-5pm |
| "When's the best time to go for a run?" | Analyzes schedule gaps, weather (if available), and suggests optimal times |

### Daily Briefing

Generated each morning (configurable time) and delivered via push notification + in-app card:

1. **Schedule overview:** Key events and meetings for the day
2. **Task priorities:** Top 3 tasks ranked by urgency/importance
3. **Focus recommendation:** Suggested focus sessions based on schedule gaps
4. **Habit check-in:** Which habits are due today, current streaks
5. **AI insights:** Patterns noticed (e.g., "You're most productive in the morning -- I've scheduled your deep work then")

### Schedule Optimization

The AI analyzes the user's calendar to:
- Identify overbooked days and suggest rescheduling
- Group similar meetings to reduce context switching
- Protect deep work blocks from being fragmented
- Suggest breaks between back-to-back meetings
- Balance workload across the week

### AI & Voice Processing Pipeline

![BetterSelf AI & Voice Pipeline](diagrams/ai_voice_pipeline.png)

> Generated from `diagrams/ai_voice_pipeline.py`. To regenerate: `cd docs/design/diagrams && python3 ai_voice_pipeline.py`

---

## Design Language

- **Inspiration:** Headspace (calming, rounded corners, friendly) -- but NOT orange
- **Primary palette:** Soft blues (#5B8DEF), lavender purples (#9B8FE8), teals (#4ECDC4) on light backgrounds (#F8F9FA); dark mode with deep navy (#1A1B2E) and charcoal (#2D2D3F)
- **Typography:** SF Pro Rounded -- matches Headspace's friendly feel while staying native iOS
- **Corner radius:** 16-20pt for cards, 12pt for buttons, full rounding for pills/badges
- **Illustrations:** Minimal abstract blob shapes and soft gradients (calming, not childish)
- **Animations:** Smooth purposeful micro-animations
  - Breathing animation on the focus timer
  - Voice waveform during AI listening/speaking
  - Gentle card transitions and haptic feedback
  - Progress ring animations for streaks/goals
- **Spacing:** Generous padding (16-24pt), card-based layouts, no visual clutter
- **Shadows:** Soft, diffused shadows (2-4pt blur) for depth without harshness

## Development Phases & Milestones

### Phase 0: Pre-Development (Day 1)

Before any code is written, these **blocking items** must be completed:

| Action | Owner | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Submit Google Cloud Console OAuth consent screen for verification | Dev B | Google's security review takes 4-6 weeks. Starting Day 1 avoids blocking M7 calendar integration. |
| Apply for FamilyControls entitlement | Dev A | Apple's approval process is unpredictable. Early application gives maximum buffer. |

---

## Scope-Cut Triggers

If the team falls behind schedule, cut features in this order (lowest impact first). Every sync point (see `developer_roadmaps.md`) includes a scope check against these triggers.

| Priority | Feature to Cut | Trigger | Impact on MVP |
|----------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| Cut first | M27: Live Activities | >3 days behind at Phase D sync | Nice-to-have. Lock screen timer is polish, not core. |
| Cut second | M26: iOS Widgets | >5 days behind at Phase D sync | Users can still access everything from the app itself. |
| Cut third | M28: Siri Shortcuts | >5 days behind at Phase E start | Voice interaction still works in-app via push-to-talk. |
| Cut fourth | Meeting prep (in M17) | AI Sprint planning shows complexity | Strip from AI action parser. Daily briefing + scheduling covers 90% of value. |
| Cut fifth | Advanced analytics (in M19) | Backend Sprint 3 overflows | Basic streak/count is enough for launch. Rich charts are post-MVP. |
| **Never cut** | App blocking (M4-M5) | -- | Core value prop #1. |
| **Never cut** | AI chat + calendar actions (M8, M17, M23) | -- | Core value prop #2. |
| **Never cut** | Calendar sync (M7, M25) | -- | Required for AI to be useful. |

---

## Post-MVP Feature Roadmap

Features identified during planning to be added after initial launch:

1. **Proactive AI Suggestions** -- Location/time/schedule-aware cards that surface recommendations without the user asking (uses CoreLocation, time-of-day, and schedule context)
2. **Social Features** -- Accountability partners, shared focus sessions, friend streak visibility
3. **Gamification** -- Streaks, points, levels, badges, weekly challenges
4. **Apple Watch App** -- Focus timer on wrist, quick AI voice commands, haptic break reminders
5. **Customizable AI Personas** -- Let users choose tone: strict coach, friendly buddy, neutral assistant
6. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** -- Detailed screen time trends, productivity scores, weekly/monthly reports with visualizations
7. **Siri Conversational Shortcuts** -- Deeper Siri integration for multi-turn conversations via App Intents

## Risk Areas & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| FamilyControls entitlement approval delayed | Cannot ship app blocking | Apply during Phase A. Build accountability/nudge UI as fallback. |
| Voice latency (AWS round-trip 3-5s) | Poor UX for voice interaction | Use Apple Speech on-device for transcription, send text to Bedrock, Polly only for response. Show "thinking" animation. |
| Google Calendar OAuth verification delay | Google security review can take 4-6 weeks. If started late, blocks calendar integration. | **Start OAuth consent screen verification on Day 1 of Phase 0.** Submit with screenshots and description immediately. Ship with Apple Calendar only if Google verification is delayed. |
| RDS free tier expiry (12 months) | Cost increases by ~$12/month after free tier ends | Plan for db.t4g.micro ($12/month) or evaluate Aurora Serverless v2 if traffic justifies auto-scaling at that point. |
| Lambda connection exhaustion | Lambda cold starts can exhaust PostgreSQL connection limit | RDS Proxy pools connections -- handles this automatically. Monitor CloudWatch `DatabaseConnections` metric. |
| Bedrock model availability/cost | AI features too expensive | Implement token budgeting per user tier. Use smaller models for simple actions, larger for complex reasoning. |
| App Store review rejection | Launch delay | Review Apple's guidelines early, especially for FamilyControls. Prepare appeals documentation. |

---

## Privacy & Security

- All data encrypted at rest (AWS default encryption) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Cognito handles auth tokens; refresh tokens stored in iOS Keychain
- Calendar data: user explicitly grants EventKit permission; Google Calendar uses OAuth scopes limited to calendar read/write
- FamilyControls: user must explicitly authorize; app cannot access which specific apps are installed, only shield selected categories/apps
- AI conversations: stored in PostgreSQL with user_id foreign key; users can delete conversation history
- Voice audio: processed in real-time, not stored (transcribed text is stored as part of conversation)
- GDPR/privacy: data export and account deletion endpoints in the API
- No data sold to third parties
